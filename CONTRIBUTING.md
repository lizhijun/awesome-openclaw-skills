# Contributing to Awesome OpenClaw Skills

A curated list of skills for OpenClaw. We organize links to skills hosted in the [official OpenClaw skills repo](https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills).

> This repository is a curated list of links — nothing more. Every skill listed here **must already be published** in the [official OpenClaw skills repo](https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills). If your skill is not there, we cannot accept it here. Publish your skill to the OpenClaw skills repo first, then come back and submit a PR to add a link.

## Adding a Skill

### Entry Format

Add your skill to the end of the relevant category in `README.md`:

```markdown
- [skill-name](https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills/author/skill-name/SKILL.md) - Short description of what it does.
```

If an author has multiple skills in the same area, please don't add them one by one. Instead, link to the author's parent folder and write a general description. This keeps the list clean and avoids unnecessary clutter.

```markdown
- [author-skills](https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills/author) - Brief summary covering all skills.
```

### Where to Add

- Find the matching category in `README.md` and add your entry at the end of that section.
- If no existing category fits, add to the closest match or suggest a new category in your PR description.

### Requirements

- **Skill must already be published to the [OpenClaw official skills repo](https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills).** We do not accept skills hosted elsewhere — no personal repos, no gists, no external links. If it's not in the OpenClaw skills repo, it doesn't belong here.
- Has documentation (SKILL.md)
- Description must be concise — 10 words or fewer
- Skill must have real community usage. We focus on community-adopted, proven skills published by development teams and proven in real-world usage. Brand new skills are not accepted — give your skill time to mature and gain users before submitting
- No crypto, blockchain, DeFi, or finance-related skills for now

### PR Title

`Add skill: author/skill-name`

## Updating an Existing Entry

- Fix broken links, typos, or outdated descriptions via PR
- If a skill has been removed or deprecated, open an issue or submit a PR to remove it

## Security Policy

We only include skills whose security status on [ClawHub](https://www.clawhub.ai/) is **not flagged as suspicious**. Skills that are marked as suspicious on ClawHub will not be accepted into this list.

If you believe a skill currently in this list has a security concern or should be flagged, please [open an issue](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-clawdbot-skills/issues) so we can review and remove it.

## Important

- This repository curates links only. Each skill lives in the official OpenClaw skills repo.
- Verify your links work before submitting.
- We review all submissions and may decline skills that don't meet the quality bar.
- Do not submit duplicate skills that serve the same purpose as an existing entry.
